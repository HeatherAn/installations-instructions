# Install VSCode on Windows

1. Download the **Visual Studio Code installer for Windows**.   
2. Once it is downloaded, run the installer (`VSCodeUserSetup-{version}.exe`). This will only take a minute.   
3. By default, VS Code is installed under `C:\Users\{Username}\AppData\Local\Programs\Microsoft VS Code`   

**Make sure Visual Studio Code is added to your PATH**. Verify this by typing `code` in the Git Bash terminal. This should launch VSCode.

Install the following VScode extensions:

* Git Graph
