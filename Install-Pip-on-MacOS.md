1. Download the `get-pip.py` file from [here](https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py) and store it in the same directory as where python is installed. You can also use the following command to download pip directly: 

`curl https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py -o get-pip.py`  

2. Execute the downloaded file using the following command:   

`python3 get-pip.py`  

and wait through the installation process.  

## Verify
 
Go to the command line and execute the following command:  

`pip3 --version`  

The pip version should be printed to the screen of the terminal.
