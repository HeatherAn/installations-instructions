On Linux the default Shell is usually Bash and there is usually **no need to install anything**.

To see if your default shell is Bash type: open a terminal and type `echo $SHELL` and press the `Enter` key. If the message printed does not end with `/bash` then your default shell is something else, and you can run Bash by typing `bash` in the terminal.
