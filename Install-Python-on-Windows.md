You can get Python via Anaconda. Or you can install Python separately.

# Python Installation via Anaconda

1. Go to the [Anaconda download website](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual#Downloads).  
2. Download the **64-Bit Graphical Installer for Windows**.  
3. Install **Python 3** by running the **Anaconda Installer**, using most of all of the defaults for installation. The only default setting you may have to change is the one to **Add Anaconda to my PATH environment variable**. Please make sure to select that option, so that Anaconda is added to your `$PATH`.  

## Verify

To ensure that Python is succesfully installed on your system follow the given steps:

- Open the **Git Bash**.   
- Make sure you activate anaconda by using `conda activate` (you should be the `(base)` environment)  
- Type `python` and press `Enter`.  

The version of the python which you have installed will be displayed if the python is successfully installed on your windows. If it is not found, then type `where conda`, and add the folder where the `conda.exe` is to your Windows PATH.  


# Python Installation NOT via Anaconda

1. Go to the [official site of python] (www.python.org). Move to the **Download for Windows** section. All the available versions of Python will be listed.    
2. Select a version of Python that works on your Windows version (recommendation: choose Python 3.8 or newer). On clicking **download**, various available executable installers shall be visible with different operating system specifications. Choose the installer which suits your system operating system and download the installer.   
3. Run the installer.
