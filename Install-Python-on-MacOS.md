# Install Python on MacOS

MacOS usually comes with a Python version. Thus first check which Python version has been pre-installed in your system by typing the following commands in the **Terminal**:

```
python --version
python3 --version
```

If you only get a **Python 2** version (not **Python 3**) then the recommendation is to install a **Python 3** version. For this:

1. First, download an installer package from the [Python website](https://www.python.org/downloads/) on your Mac.   
2. Once the download is complete, double-click the package to start installing Python. You may have to enter your Mac password to let it know that you agree with installing Python. If youâ€™re using Apple M1 Mac, you need to install **Rosetta**. Rosetta enables Intel-based features to run on Apple silicon Macs.  
3. When the installation completes, it will open up the Python folder.  

Note: you can also have Python if you install Anaconda (in case of interest see [here](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/mac-os/)). 

## Verify

Go to your terminal and type:

```
python3 --version
```

If Python 3 has been installed correctly, the version of Python 3 will be printed to the terminal.
