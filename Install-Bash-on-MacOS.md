The default Shell in some versions of macOS is Bash, so **no need to install anything**. In new versions Zsh is the default Shell. But Bash will also be installed.

To see if your default Shell is Bash: open a terminal (found in `/Applications/Utilities`) and 
type `echo $SHELL` and press the `Return` key. If the message printed does not end with `/bash` then your default is something else, and you can run Bash by typing `bash` on the terminal.

If your default Shell is zsh, in the terminal you can type `bash` and then the Shell will change to Bash.
