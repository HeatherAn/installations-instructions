**Git** should be installed on your computer as part of the **Git Bash** install. 

If you skipped the **Install Bash on Windows** part, go to [Install Bash on Windows](Install-Bash-on-Windows) and follow the instructions there.

## Verify

To verify Git has been properly installed:  

- Open the Git Bash application  
- Type `git --version` and press `Enter`  

You should see a message reporting the version number.
