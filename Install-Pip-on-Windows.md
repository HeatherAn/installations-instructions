1. Download the `get-pip.py` file from [here](https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py) and store it in the same directory as where python is installed. To see where python has been installed, open Git-Bash terminal and run `where python`. The path shown in the terminal, shows where python has been installed.  
2. In the Git-Bash terminal go to the directory where the above file exists by doing `cd <path_to_where_python_is_installed>`.    
3. Run the command given below:  

`python get-pip.py`  

And wait through the installation process.  

## Verify

Go to the command line and execute the following command:

`pip -V`

The pip version should be printed in the screen of the terminal.
